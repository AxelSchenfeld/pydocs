Flow control in Python allows you to modify the behavior of loops and conditionals using special statements like `pass`, `continue`, and `break`. These statements help manage how and when certain parts of your code are executed.

## `pass`

The `pass` statement acts as a placeholder. It does nothing but ensures the code is syntactically correct.

<Code 
code="
for letter in 'python':
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if letter == 'h':
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass  # Does nothing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(letter)
"
lang="py"
title="pass.py"
mark="highlights" />

## `continue`

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.

<Code 
code="
for number in range(5):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if number == 2:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue  # Skips number 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(number)
"
lang="py"
title="continue.py"
mark="highlights" />

## `break`

The `break` statement immediately ends the loop, regardless of the loop condition.

<Code 
code="
for number in range(5):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if number == 3:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break  # Exits the loop when number is 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(number)
"
lang="py"
title="break.py"
mark="highlights" />

<Aside type="note">
These statements are useful for controlling the execution flow in loops and conditionals, making your code more flexible and readable.
