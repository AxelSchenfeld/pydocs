This documentation will guide you to get started quickly. In Python, loops are structures that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met. There are two main types of loops: for and while. The for loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string), while the while loop executes code while a condition is true.

## `for`

The for loop is ideal for iterating over the elements of a sequence (list, tuple, string, etc.).

<Code
code="
    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
    for fruit in fruits:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(fruit)

    # This code will print each fruit from the list.
"

## `while`

The while loop executes a block of code while a condition is true.

<Code
code="
counter = 0
while counter < 10:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(counter)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counter += 1

# Will print numbers from 0 to 9.
"

<Aside type="caution">
In `while` loops, it's crucial to ensure that the condition can eventually become false to avoid infinite loops.
</Aside>

## Key Differences

- `for` : Better for iterating over elements of a sequence when the number of iterations is known in advance.
- `while` : Better for executing a block of code while a condition is true, when the number of iterations is not known in advance.
