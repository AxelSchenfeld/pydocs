In this section, you will learn two key concepts of object-oriented programming: **encapsulation** and **polymorphism**. Both help you write safer, more flexible, and reusable code.

---

## Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** consists of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only what is necessary. This protects the object's internal state and controls how it is accessed or modified.

### How is it implemented in Python?

- "Private" attributes and methods are named with an underscore (`_attribute` or `__attribute`).
- Methods called **getters** and **setters** are used to access or modify attributes if necessary.

<Code
code="
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # private attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

account = BankAccount(100)
account.deposit(50)
print(account.get_balance())  # 150
"
lang="py"
title="Encapsulation with private attributes"
frame="auto"
/>

In this example, the balance can only be modified by the defined methods, not directly from outside the class.

---

## Polymorphism

**Polymorphism** allows different classes to share the same method (name), but each has its own implementation. Thus, you can use objects of different classes interchangeably if they comply with the same interface.

### Polymorphism Example

<Code
code="
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print('Makes a sound')

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print('Woof!')

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print('Meow!')

animals = [Dog(), Cat()]

for animal in animals:
    animal.speak()
"
lang="py"
title="Polymorphism in action"
frame="auto"
/>

**Output:**
```
Woof!
Meow!
```

Each object responds differently to the same `speak` method, depending on its class.

---

## Summary

- **Encapsulation:** protects internal data and controls access to it.
- **Polymorphism:** allows the use of different objects uniformly if they share methods with the same name.
- Both concepts make your code safer, more flexible, and easier to maintain.
