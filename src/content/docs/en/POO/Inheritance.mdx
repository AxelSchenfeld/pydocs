**Inheritance** is a fundamental pillar of object-oriented programming. It allows you to create new classes based on existing classes, reusing and extending their functionality. This way, you can model "is a" relationships (for example, a `Dog` is an `Animal`).

---

## Why use inheritance?

- **Code reuse:** Avoid repeating common attributes and methods.
- **Organization:** Allows structuring logical hierarchies between classes.
- **Extension:** You can add or modify behaviors in subclasses.

---

## Basic syntax

To create a class that inherits from another, simply indicate the base class in parentheses:

```python
class BaseClass:
    # attributes and methods

class SubClass(BaseClass):
    # new attributes and methods
```

---

## Simple example

Suppose you have an `Animal` class and you want to create a `Dog` class that inherits from it:

<Code
code="
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        print('Makes a sound')

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print(f'{self.name} says: Woof!')

my_dog = Dog('Rex')
my_dog.speak()  # Rex says: Woof!
"
lang="py"
title="Basic inheritance"
frame="auto"
/>

In this example, `Dog` inherits the `name` attribute and the `speak` method from `Animal`, but redefines it to customize the behavior.

---

## Using `super()`

You can call methods of the base class using `super()`. This is useful for extending functionality without completely replacing it.

<Code
code="
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def describe(self):
        print(f'I am an animal called {self.name}')

class Cat(Animal):
    def describe(self):
        super().describe()
        print('And I am a cat.')

g = Cat('Michi')
g.describe()
"
lang="py"
title="Using super()"
frame="auto"
/>

**Output:**
```
I am an animal called Michi
And I am a cat.
```

---

## Multiple inheritance

In Python, a class can inherit from multiple classes at the same time:

```python
class ClassA:
    pass

class ClassB:
    pass

class SubClass(ClassA, ClassB):
    pass
```

---

## Summary

- **Inheritance** allows you to create classes that reuse and extend others.
- Use `super()` to access methods of the base class.
- You can redefine methods to customize the behavior in subclasses.
- Python allows multiple inheritance.

Ready to practice? Try creating a base class `Vehicle` and a subclass `Car` that adds its own method.
