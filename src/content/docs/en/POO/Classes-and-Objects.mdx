Python is a language with support for object-oriented programming. This means you can model real-world elements as **objects** that have **properties** (attributes) and **behaviors** (methods), using **classes** as a blueprint to create them.

---

## What is a Class?

A **class** is a template or blueprint used to create objects (instances). It groups data and functions that operate on that data.

<Code 
code="
class Product:
    pass
"
lang="py" 
title="Class Definition" 
mark="highlights"
frame='auto' />

In this example, `Product` is the name of the class. For now, it has no attributes or methods.

---

## The `__init__` Method

The special method `__init__` is the **constructor** of the class. It is automatically executed when you create a new instance (object) and is used to initialize the object's attributes.

<Code 
code="
class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
"
lang="py" 
title="Constructor (__init__)" 
mark="highlights"
frame='auto' />

When you create a new product with `Product("Shoe", 50)`, the `__init__` method assigns `"Shoe"` to `self.name` and `50` to `self.price`.

---

## The `self` Parameter

`self` is a reference to the object itself. It is used within the class's methods to access or modify the attributes and to call other methods of the same object. It **must** always be the first parameter of any instance method, although you do not pass it explicitly when calling the method.

<Code 
code="
class Product:
    def display_info(self):
        print(self.name, self.price)
"
lang="py" 
title="Usage of self" 
mark="highlights"
frame='auto' />

When you call `p.display_info()`, Python automatically passes the object `p` as an argument for `self`.

---

## Complete Example

Let's see a complete example of how to define a class, create an object, and use its methods:

<Code
code="
class Product:
    def __init__(self, name, price):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

    def display_info(self):
        print(f'Product: {self.name} | Price: ${self.price}')

# Create an object
p1 = Product('Shirt', 25.99)

# Use the method
p1.display_info()
"
lang="py"
title="Product Class Example"
frame="auto"
/>

**Output:**
```
Product: Shirt | Price: $25.99
```

## Summary

- A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects.
- The `__init__` method initializes the object's attributes.
- The `self` parameter allows access to the object's attributes and methods.
- You can create multiple objects from the same class, each with its own values.
