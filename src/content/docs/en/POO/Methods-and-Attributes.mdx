Now that you know what a class is and how to create objects, it's time to delve into two key concepts: **attributes** and **methods**. These are the fundamental components that give functionality and characteristics to your objects.

---

## What are Attributes?

**Attributes** are variables that store information about the state of an object. Each object can have different values for its attributes.

<Code
code="
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

p1 = Person('Ana', 30)
print(p1.name)  # Ana
print(p1.age)    # 30
"
lang="py"
title="Instance Attributes"
frame="auto"
/>

In this example, `name` and `age` are attributes of each `Person` object.

---

## What are Methods?

**Methods** are functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors of objects. They always receive at least one parameter: `self`, which represents the object itself.

<Code
code="
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        print(f'Hello, I am {self.name}!')

p1 = Person('Ana')
p1.greet()  # Hello, I am Ana!
"
lang="py"
title="Instance Method"
frame="auto"
/>

---

## Types of Attributes

- **Instance attributes:** Are unique to each object (like `self.name`).
- **Class attributes:** Are shared by all instances of the class.

<Code
code="
class Pet:
    species = 'Dog'  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute

m1 = Pet('Rex')
m2 = Pet('Luna')
print(m1.species)  # Dog
print(m2.species)  # Dog
"
lang="py"
title="Class and Instance Attributes"
frame="auto"
/>

---

## Types of Methods

- **Instance methods:** Use `self` and operate on the object.
- **Class methods:** Use `@classmethod` and receive `cls` as the first parameter.
- **Static methods:** Use `@staticmethod` and receive neither `self` nor `cls`.

<Code
code="
class Calculator:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    @classmethod
    def description(cls):
        return 'Simple calculator'

print(Calculator.add(3, 4))         # 7
print(Calculator.description())        # Simple calculator
"
lang="py"
title="Static and Class Methods"
frame="auto"
/>

---

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names for attributes and methods.
- Private attributes (for internal use only) are named with an underscore: `_attribute`.
- Document your methods using docstrings.

---

## Summary

- **Attributes**: store object information.
- **Methods**: define object behaviors.
- There are instance, class, and static attributes and methods.
- Mastering these concepts allows you to create more useful and flexible classes.
