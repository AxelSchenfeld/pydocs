Creating your own **modules** in Python is an excellent way to organize, reuse, and share your code. A module is simply a `.py` file that contains functions, classes, or variables that you can import and use in other programs.

---

## Why Create Modules?

- **Organization:** Divides your project into smaller, more manageable files.
- **Reuse:** Uses the same code in different programs without copying and pasting.
- **Maintenance:** Makes it easier to update and fix errors in one place.

---

## How to Create a Module?

1. **Create a `.py` file**
   For example, create a file called `greetings.py` with the following content:

<Code
code={`
def greet(name):
    print(f'Hello, {name}!')
`}
lang="py"
title="greetings.py"
frame="auto"
/>

2. **Import your module into another file**
   Now, in your main file, you can import and use the function:

<Code
code={`
import greetings

greetings.greet('Ana')
`}
lang="py"
title="Using a Custom Module"
frame="auto"
/>

**Output:**
```
Hello, Ana!
```

## Import Specific Functions

You can also import only what you need from your module:

<Code
code={`
from greetings import greet

greet('Carlos')
`}
lang="py"
title="Importing a Specific Function"
frame="auto"
/>

---

## Where Should Modules Be Located?

For Python to find your module, it must be in the same directory as your main file or in a folder included in the *PYTHONPATH*.

---

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names for your modules and functions.
- Avoid spaces and special characters in file names.
- Keep each module focused on a single task or theme.

---

## Summary

- Creating modules helps you organize and reuse your code.
- You only need a `.py` file to get started.
- Import your modules and functions as needed in your projects.
