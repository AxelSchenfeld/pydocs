# Using Packages in Python

In Python, a **package** is a way to organize and group several related modules into a folder structure. Packages help you keep your code organized, scalable, and easy to maintain, especially in large projects.

---

## What is a Package?

A package is simply a folder that contains a special file called `__init__.py` (can be empty) and one or more modules (`.py`).
This tells Python that the folder should be treated as a package.

**Example of a package structure:**

<FileTree>
- my_package/
  - `__init__.py`
  - module1.py
  - module2.py
</FileTree>

## Why Use Packages?

- **Organization:** Groups related modules under the same folder.
- **Scalability:** Makes it easier to grow your project without losing control.
- **Reuse:** You can import only what you need from each package.

## How to Create and Use a Package?

1. **Create the package folder**
   For example, create a folder called `utilities` and inside it a file `__init__.py` (can be empty).

2. **Add your modules**
   For example, create a file `math.py` inside the folder:

<Code
code={`
# utilities/math.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
`}
lang="py"
title="Module Inside a Package"
frame="auto"
/>

3. **Import from your package**
   In your main file, import the module or function you need:

<Code
code={`
from utilities import math

print(math.add(3, 4))  # 7
`}
lang="py"
title="Importing a Module from a Package"
frame="auto"
/>

You can also import specific functions:

<Code
code={`
from utilities.math import add

print(add(10, 5))  # 15
`}
lang="py"
title="Importing a Specific Function from a Package"
frame="auto"
/>

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names for your packages and modules.
- Keep each package focused on a single topic or functionality.
- Place an `__init__.py` file in each package folder (even if it is empty).

---

## Summary

- Packages group related modules and help organize large projects.
- You only need a folder with `__init__.py` and your modules.
- Import modules or functions as needed.

Ready to practice? Create your own package with several modules and test it in a program.
