An operator is a symbol or keyword that tells Python to perform a specific operation on one or more values (also called operands). Operators allow you to perform tasks like adding numbers, comparing values, assigning results to variables, or evaluating logical conditions.

## Types of operators

In Python, just like in other languages, there are a variety of operator types which we will teach you below.

### Arithmetic Operators

These are the most basic operators and are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Python uses them to work with numbers directly.

<PyTable 
  headers={["Operator", "Description"]}
  rows={[
    ["+", "Addition"],
    ["-", "Subtraction"],
    ["*", "Multiplication"],
    ["/", "Division (float result)"],
    ["//", "Integer division"],
    ["%", "Modulo (remainder)"],
    ["**", "Power"],
    // m치s filas...
  ]}
/>



<Code 
code="x = 12 
      y = 24
      
      print(x + y)   # Result: 36
      print(x - y)   # Result: -12
      print(x * y)   # Result: 288
      print(x / y)   # Result: 0.5
      print(x // y)  # Result: 0
      print(x % y)   # Result: 12
      "

<Aside type="tip" title="Challenge">

```python
# What number do you get when using x ** y?
# Hint: it's 12 raised to the 24th power. Very big!
```
</Aside>

### Comparison Operators

These operators allow you to compare two values. The result of a comparison is always a boolean value: True if the condition is met, and False if not.

<PyTable 
  headers={["Operator", "Description"]}
  rows={[
    ["==", "Equal to"],
    ["!=", "Not equal to"],
    [">", "Greater than"],
    ["<", "Less than"],
    [">=", "Greater than or equal to"],
    ["<=", "Less than or equal to"],
    // m치s filas...
  ]}
/>

<Code 
code="      
      print(5 == 5)   # Result: True
      print(5 != 3)   # Result: True
      print(7 > 3)   # Result: True
      print(2 < 4)   # Result: True
      print(6 >= 6)  # Result: True
      print(3 <= 5)   # Result: True
      "

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are symbols used in programming to assign a value to a variable. The most common assignment operator is the equals sign (=), but there are also compound assignment operators that combine an operation with assignment.

<PyTable 
  headers={["Operator", "Description"]}
  rows={[
    ["=", "Assignment"],
    ["+=", "Addition and assignment"],
    ["-=", "Subtraction and assignment"],
    ["*=", "Multiplication and assignment"],
    ["/=", "Division and assignment"],
    ["%=", "Modulo and assignment"],
    ["//=", "Integer division and assignment"],
    ["**=", "Power and assignment"],
    
    // m치s filas...
  ]}
/>

<Code 
code="      
      print(x = 5)   # Assigns the value 5 to x
      print(x += 3)   # x = x + 3
      print(x -= 2)   # x = x - 2
      print(x *= 4)   # x = x * 4
      print(x /= 2)   # x = x / 2
      print(x %= 3)  # x = x % 3
      print(x //= 2)   # x = x // 2
      print(x **= 3)   # x = x ** 3
      "

### Logical Operators

They are used to combine multiple conditions and get a boolean result. They are usually used in control structures like conditionals.

<PyTable 
  headers={["Operator", "Description", "Example", "Result"]}
  rows={[
    ["and", "True if both conditions are true", "True and False", "False"],
    ["or", "True if at least one condition is true","True or False","True"],
    ["not", "Inverts the value of the condition", "not True","False"],
    // m치s filas...
  ]}
/>
