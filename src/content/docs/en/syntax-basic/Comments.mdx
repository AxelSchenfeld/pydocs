In Python, comments are fundamental elements for writing clear, understandable and maintainable code. Although they don't directly affect program execution, they play a crucial role in communication between programmers (including your future self) and in documenting the code itself.

A comment is a line or text fragment included within the source code that the Python interpreter completely ignores during execution. That is, it's not translated into executable instructions nor consumes resources when running the program.

## Single-line comments

They are written by placing the # symbol before any text. Everything that appears after this symbol on the line is ignored by the interpreter:

<Code 
code="# This is a comment that explains the following line
      print('Hello PyDocs')  # Print Name 
     "
      
lang="py" 
title="Coments.py" 
mark="highlights" />

## Documentation strings

Although they are not technically "comments", you can use **docstrings** (strings between triple quotes) as internal documentation. These are placed inside functions, classes or modules and are used to describe their purpose:

<Code 
def greet():
    '''
    This function prints a greeting three times.
    '''
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print('Hello PyDocs')
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print('Hello PyDocs')
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print('Hello PyDocs')
   "
lang="py" 
title="Docstring.py" 
mark="highlights"
frame='auto' />


<Aside type="caution">
Avoid using triple quote strings as if they were multiline comments outside of a function or class, since Python **stores them in memory as text objects**, unlike real comments with `#` that are completely ignored by the interpreter.
