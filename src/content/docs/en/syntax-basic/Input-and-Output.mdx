When you write a program, not everything should stay within the code. Sometimes you need to show information to the user (output), and other times ask for data (input). In Python, this is mainly done with two very simple functions:

- `print()` to display messages or results.

- `input()` to receive data from the user.

With these two functions you can start building interactive programs.

## Print()

The `print()` function in Python is used to display information in the console. It allows you to print text, numbers, variables, and more, using simple syntax.

<Code 
code="print('Welcome to PyDocs') # Response in console  print('Welcome to PyDocs')"
       
lang="py" 
title="print.py" 
mark="highlights" />

Why don't you try printing Hello World!?

```python
  print("Hello World!")
```

## Input()

The `input()` function in Python asks the user to enter a value. Then, it reads what the user enters and returns it as a string.

<Code 
code="name = input('What is your name? ')
          print('Hello, ' + name + '!')"
       
lang="py" 
title="print.py" 
mark="highlights" />
