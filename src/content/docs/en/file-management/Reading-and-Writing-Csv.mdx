CSV files (Comma Separated Values) are plain text files that store tabular data. Each line represents a row of data and each value is separated by commas (or another delimiter like ;). They are widely used for exporting data from spreadsheets or databases.

We have the following project structure:

<FileTree>

- src
  - read_csv.py
  - write_csv.py
  - rewrite_csv.py
- docs
  - products.csv


</FileTree>

## Reading a CSV File

To read CSV files, Python provides the built-in csv module. This module allows you to iterate over rows, access columns by index or name, and handle different delimiters.

<Code
code="
import csv

with open ('./docs/products.csv', 'r') as file:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;csv_reader = csv.DictReader(file)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for row in csv_reader:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(row)
"
lang="py"
title="read_csv.py"
mark="highlights"
frame="auto" />

## Writing to a CSV File

This script opens an existing CSV file and adds a new row with product data.
Uses the 'a' mode to append at the end without deleting the previous content.

<Code
code="
import csv

# Data to add
new_product = {'name': 'Keyboard', 'price': '45'}

# Add a new row at the end of the file
with open('./docs/products.csv', 'a', newline='') as file:
    fieldnames = ['name', 'price']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fieldnames)

    # Write a new line
    writer.writerow(new_product)"
lang="py"
title="write_csv.py"
mark="highlights"
frame="auto" />


## Overwrite a CSV file

This script overwrites a CSV file with a new list of products.
Utilizes the 'w' mode to start from scratch, including the header.

<Code
code="
import csv

# List of products to overwrite the file completely
products = [
    {'name': 'Monitor', 'price': '200'},
    {'name': 'Headphones','price': '80'}
]

# Overwrite the file with new data
with open('./docs/products.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fieldnames = ['name', 'price']
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fieldnames)

    # Write header and then data
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(products)
"
lang="py"
title="overwrite_csv.py"
mark="highlights"
frame="auto" />
