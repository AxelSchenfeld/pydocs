Python provides simple and powerful tools for working with files. Common operations include opening, reading, writing, and closing files, and are primarily performed using the `open()` and `with` functions.

## `open()`

<Code
code="
open(file_route, mode)
"
lang="py"
title="open.py"
mark="highlights"
frame="auto" />

- file_route: the file's location (relative or absolute).

- mode: the operation mode

#### Opening modes

<PyTable
  headers={["Mode", "Description"]}
  rows={[
    ["r", "	Opens the file in read mode. Raises an error if the file does not exist."],
    ["w", "Opens the file in write mode. Creates the file if it does not exist or overwrites it."],
    ["a", "Opens the file in append mode. Creates the file if it does not exist and writes at the end."],
    ["r+", "Opens the file in read and write mode. Does not truncate."],
    ["w+", "Opens the file in read and write mode, but overwrites the content."],
    ["a+", "Opens the file for reading and appending. The write pointer is at the end."],
    ["rb", "Same as 'r' but in binary mode."],
    ["wb", "Same as 'w' but in binary mode."],
    ["ab", "Same as 'a' but in binary mode."],
    ["r+b", "Reading and writing in binary mode."],
    ["w+b", "Reading and writing, truncating the file, in binary mode."],
    ["a+b", "Reading and appending in binary mode."],

/>


## `with`

It is recommended to use `open()` together with the `with` statement, which ensures that the file is closed automatically at the end of the block, even if an error occurs:

<Code
code="
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contenido = file.read()
"
lang="py"
title="with.py"
mark="highlights"
frame="auto" />

- `with` opens the file and assigns it to the variable `file`.

- When exiting the `with` block, the file is closed automatically.

<Aside type="note">
This approach is cleaner, safer, and avoids errors such as files that remain open.
