## How to navigate efficiently

### Search by modules

When working with specific modules, go directly to the corresponding section:

<Code
code="
# If you're working with dates
import datetime

# Search: 'datetime' in the official documentation
# You'll find methods like strftime(), strptime(), etc.
"
lang="py"
title="Specific search example"
frame="auto"
/>

### Using the index and glossary

- **Index:** Alphabetical list of all functions and classes
- **Glossary:** Definitions of Python-specific technical terms
- **PEP (Python Enhancement Proposals):** Documents explaining new features

## Tips for maximizing documentation use

<Aside type="tip" title="Reading strategy">
Don't try to read all the documentation at once. Use it as a reference when you encounter specific concepts or need precise technical details.
</Aside>

### For beginners

1. **Start with the official tutorial** after completing PyDocs
2. **Use search** when you need information about specific functions
3. **Read the examples** included in each section

### For intermediate developers

1. **Explore the standard library** to discover useful modules
2. **Consult PEPs** to understand the language's design and evolution
3. **Review version notes** to stay updated

### For advanced developers

1. **Study the language reference** for complex use cases
2. **Participate in discussions** of new PEPs
3. **Consult source code** when you need to understand specific implementations

## Combining PyDocs with official documentation

PyDocs and the official documentation complement each other perfectly:

- **PyDocs:** Structured learning with practical examples
- **Official documentation:** Detailed technical reference and complete specifications

<Aside type="note" title="Recommendation">
Use PyDocs to learn new concepts and the official documentation to deepen technical details and resolve specific doubts during development.
</Aside>
