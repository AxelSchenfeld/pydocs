# Virtual Environments (venv) in Python

A **virtual environment** is a tool that allows you to create an isolated space for your Python projects. This way, you can install specific dependencies for each project without affecting the rest of your system or your other projects.

---

## Why use virtual environments?

- **Isolation:** Each project can have its own package versions, avoiding conflicts.
- **Organization:** Keep your dependencies separate and your system clean.
- **Reproducibility:** Makes it easier to share your project with others, ensuring that everyone uses the same library versions.

---

## How to create a virtual environment?

1. Open a terminal in your project folder.
2. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    This will create a folder named `venv` with everything you need for your virtual environment.

---

## How to activate the virtual environment?

- **On Windows:**

    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

- **On macOS/Linux:**

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    When the environment is active, you will see the environment name at the beginning of the command line.

---

## How to install packages in the environment?

With the environment activated, use `pip` to install packages only in that environment:

```bash
pip install package_name
```

---

## How to deactivate the virtual environment?

When you are finished working, you can exit the environment with:

```bash
deactivate
```

---

## Best practices

- Use a virtual environment for each project.
- Add the `venv` folder to your `.gitignore` file if you use version control.
- Save your dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file with:

    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

---

## Summary

- Virtual environments help you keep your projects organized and free from dependency conflicts.
- They are easy to create, activate, and use.
- They are an essential tool for any modern Python developer.
