# List compression in Python

**List compression** is a concise and elegant way to create lists from other sequences (lists, tuples, ranges, etc.) by applying transformations or filters in a single line of code.

---

## Why use list compression?

- Lets you write more readable and clean code.
- Is more efficient than using traditional loops to create lists.
- Facilitate applying conditions and transformations to elements.

---

## Basic syntax

The general syntax is:

```python
[new_expression for element in sequence if condition]
```

- `new_expression`: what you want to add to the new list.
- `element`: each value from the original sequence.
- `sequence`: the collection of data to iterate over.
- `condition` (optional): filters the elements that meet the condition.

## Simple example

Suppose you want to obtain a list with the squares of numbers from 1 to 5:

<Code
code="
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)
"
lang="py"
title="Squares from 1 to 5"
frame="auto"
/>

**Output:**
```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

---

## Example with condition (filter)

Now, we only want the squares of even numbers:

<Code
code="
squares_even = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6) if x % 2 == 0]
print(squares_even)
"
lang="py"
title="Squares of even numbers"
frame="auto"
/>

**Output:**
```
[4, 16]
```

---

## Comparison with traditional loops

The following code does the same, but using a `for` loop:

<Code
code="
squares = []
for x in range(1, 6):
    squares.append(x**2)
"
lang="py"
title="Traditional loop"
frame="auto"
/>

As you can see, list comprehension is more compact and easier to read.

## Summary

- List comprehension allows you to create new lists concisely and efficiently.
- You can transform and filter elements in a single line.
- It is a powerful tool for working with collections in Python.

Are you ready to practice? Try creating a list with the odd numbers from 1 to 20 using list comprehension.
